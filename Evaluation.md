## Project Evaluation: FAQ Matching System

### 1. Relevance
- **Current Approach**: Uses Sentence-BERT and cosine similarity to match user queries with FAQ entries.
- **Strengths**: Highly relevant matches due to semantic understanding.
- **Suggested Improvements**: Fine-tune Sentence-BERT on domain-specific FAQs for even better relevance.

### 2. Performance
- **Strengths**: Precomputing FAQ embeddings speeds up response times.
- **Concerns**: With large FAQ datasets, calculating similarity for every FAQ may slow down response times.
- **Suggested Improvements**:
  - Use **FAISS** for fast approximate nearest neighbor searches for large datasets.
  - Implement **caching** to store frequently asked queries and responses.

### 3. Integration
- **Current Approach**: The solution integrates well with any website using a modular React frontend and Django REST API backend.
- **No changes needed**.

### 4. User Experience
- **Strengths**: Clean UI with intuitive input, default questions, and voice search.
- **Suggested Improvements**:
  - Add support for returning multiple relevant FAQs with confidence scores.
  - Add pagination for long FAQs or responses.

### 5. Flexibility
- **Strengths**: Sentence-BERT allows semantic interpretation of queries.
- **Suggested Improvements**: Add a synonym expansion mechanism to handle more diverse queries.

### 6. Scalability
- **Current Limitations**: A static JSON file limits scalability for large datasets.
- **Suggested Improvements**:
  - Store FAQs in a **database** (e.g., PostgreSQL).
  - Use **FAISS** for large-scale FAQ search.
  - Add **Celery** for background tasks like re-indexing and computing embeddings for new FAQs.

### 7. Technology Choice
- **Strengths**: React.js, Django REST Framework, and Sentence-BERT are appropriate technologies for the task.
- **Suggested Improvements**: For scaling, deploy with **Gunicorn** and **Nginx**, and use **FAISS** for large FAQ datasets.
